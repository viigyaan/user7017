        Ingredients:
        <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Sesame seeds: 500 grams</li>
            <li>Boora/shakkar: 250 grams</li>
            <li>Cashew nuts: 10-12 (coarsely chopped)</li>
            <li>Almonds: 10-12 (coarsely chopped)</li>
            <li>Raisins: Â½ cup</li>

        </div>
        <div>
        Method:
             Heat ghee in a pan. Add coarsely chopped almonds and cashew nuts. Roast on medium-low flame until golden brown and crunchy. Take the nuts out of the pan and keep aside. Clean the sesame seeds and dry roast them on low flame in the same pan. Keep stirring until the seeds become light golden in colour and start leaving a nutty fragrance. Turn off the flame and transfer the roasted seeds in a plate immediately to stop further cooking. Let them cool completely at room temperature. Mix boora or shakkar in them after they cool down. Blend them in a food processor to grind the sesame seeds into rough powder form and mix boora well with this sesame seed powder. The tilkut is ready. Take out from the blender and transfer the tilkut in a big mixing bowl. Add raisins, roasted almonds and cashew nuts to enhance the richness and taste of this delicacy. Mix well with a spoon. Store in an airtight box.

        With a nutty crunch and sweet flavour, tilkut is a popular traditional sweet treat loved extremely in India during cold months. Apart from its sweet and lip-smacking taste, the combination of protein and minerals makes it a wholesome food. Roast them and blend with boora or shakkar, the choice is all yours.
        
        Tips to make perfect tilkut:
        
        Clean the sesame seeds before roasting. Check for adulterants or small stones.
        
        Dry roast sesame seeds in a thick-bottomed pan on low flame so that they become crunchy inside-out.
        
        Keep stirring frequently while roasting so as to prevent the burning of the seeds and allow even roasting.
        
        Before grinding them with boora or shakkar, let them cool down properly at room temperature to make perfect crunchy tilkut.
        
        Never mix boora in hot sesame seeds, otherwise, boora or shakkar will melt and leave moisture in the tilkut spoiling its taste and texture.
        
        Store it in an airtight box so that it remains crispy and fresh for two to three weeks. It does not taste good when chilled. So do not store it in a refrigerator.</p>
